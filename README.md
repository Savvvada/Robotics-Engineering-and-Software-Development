# Robotics-Engineering-and-Software-Development

Introduction:
A personal research-driven project, that delves into the intricacies of Robotics, their utility, and relevant software devolpment.
The end goal of this project is to create a semi-autnomous car that can circumvent arbitrary obstacles on its path. This project uses a "GoPiGo3" and a Raspeberry Pi. Despite this project being accomplished using the aforementioned materials, the project is in no way streamlined, and throughout its development, new innovate features will be added to the aforementioned base goal. Therefore, in tandem with the goal of creating an autonomous car, various other features will be added with the aim of displaying creativity and utility. All of the programming done in this project will be done in "Scratch" and Python. This project will implement various sensors(cameras, Torque sensore, etc.) to implement new features such as: Computer Vision, Anti-lock Braking, etc. As the project progresses it will be extensively documented.
