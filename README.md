# Robotics-Engineering-and-Software-Development

Introduction:
A personal research-driven project, that delves into the intricacies of Robtics, their utility, and relevant software devolpment.
The end goal of this project is to create a semi-autnomous car that can circumvent arbitrary obstacles on its path to its destination. This project uses a "GoPiGo3" and a Raspeberry Pi. Despite this project being accomplished using the aforementioned materials, the project is no way streamlined, and throughout the development new innovate new features will be added to the base goal. Therefore, in tandem with the base goal of creating an autonomous car, various other feature will be added with the aim of displaying creativity and utility. All of the programming done in this project will be done in "Scratch" and Python. The project will implement various sensors(cameras, Torque sensore, etc.) to accomplish features such as: Computer Vision, and Anti-lock Braking. As the project progresses it will be extensively documented.
