# Robotics-Engineering-and-Software-Development

Introduction
A personal research-driven project, that delves into the intricacies of Robtics, their utility, and relevant software devolpment.
The end goal of this project is to create a fully autnomous car that can navigate across multiple terrains with arbitrary obstacles it must circumvent on the trek to its destination. This project uses a "GoPiGo3" and a Raspeberry Pi. Despite this project being accomplished using the aforementioned materials, the project is no way streamlined, and in multiple instances it is rewuired to cnstantly innovate new features. So in tandem with the base goal of creating an autonomous car, various other feature will be added with the aim of displaying creativity and utility. All of the programming done in this project will be done in Scratch and Python. As the project progresses it will be extensively documented.
